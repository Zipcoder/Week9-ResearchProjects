Project Goal:
In this project, I will choose: R as the lanuage, MongoDB as the NoSQL database, and ggplot2/plotly as the data visulization tools.


What I did:
1. a selected dataset based on the LEGO product database from 1950 to 2017. 
2. The MongoDB was installed and imported the LEGO dataset. (simple CRUD proceudure included)
3. R was connected to MongoDB by using library(mongolite). 
4. ggplot2 was used for the preliminary plot for data visualization. 
5. Then plotly was applied to the live charts (including 2D, 3D, even more dimension plots)
